# flagd Provider for OpenFeature

Given below is the architecture of the provider implementation.

## Building

`mvn compile` will pull the `schemas` and `sync` submodule, and build the gRPC resources.
Note that in some editors, you will need to disable some automatic compilation options to prevent your editor from cleaning them.
In vscode for instance, the following settings are recommended:

```json
{
  "java.configuration.updateBuildConfiguration": "automatic",
  "java.autobuild.enabled": false,
  "java.compile.nullAnalysis.mode": "automatic"
}
```

## End-to-End Tests

The continuous integration runs a set of [gherkin e2e tests](https://github.com/open-feature/test-harness/blob/main/features/evaluation.feature) using [`flagd`](https://github.com/open-feature/flagd). These tests do not run with the default maven profile. If you'd like to run them locally, you can start the flagd testbed with

```
docker-compose up
```
and then run 
```
mvn test -P e2e
```

Note if your docker compose networking does not resolve to localhost, you can set a custom host
```
FLAGD_HOST=192.168.100.1 mvn test -P e2e
```

If test-harness is being updated, commit the changes before running `mvn`.
Otherwise, uncommitted changes will be overridden by maven test plugins.
