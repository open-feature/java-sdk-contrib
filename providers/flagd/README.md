# flagd Provider for OpenFeature

![Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/experimental-breaking%20changes%20allowed-yellow)

A feature flag daemon with a Unix philosophy.

## Installation
<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>dev.openfeature.contrib.providers</groupId>
  <artifactId>flagd</artifactId>
  <version>0.5.5</version>
</dependency>
```
<!-- x-release-please-end-version -->

## Usage

The `FlagdProvider` communicates with flagd via the gRPC protocol. Instantiate a new FlagdProvider instance, and configure the OpenFeature SDK to use it:

```java
FlagdProvider provider = new FlagdProvider();
OpenFeatureAPI.getInstance().setProvider(provider);
```

Options can be defined in the constructor or as environment variables, with constructor options having the highest precedence.

| Option name           | Environment variable name       | Type    | Default   | Values        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------- | --------- | ------------- |
| host                  | FLAGD_HOST                      | string  | localhost |               |
| port                  | FLAGD_PORT                      | number  | 8013      |               |
| tls                   | FLAGD_TLS                       | boolean | false     |               |
| socketPath            | FLAGD_SOCKET_PATH               | string  | -         |               |
| certPath              | FLAGD_SERVER_CERT_PATH          | string  | -         |               |
| cache                 | FLAGD_CACHE                     | string  | lru       | lru,disabled  |
| maxCacheSize          | FLAGD_MAX_CACHE_SIZE            | int     | 1000      |               |
| maxEventStreamRetries | FLAGD_MAX_EVENT_STREAM_RETRIES  | int     | 5         |               |

### Unix socket support

Unix socket communication with flag is facilitated via usage of the linux-native `epoll` library on `linux-x86_64` only (ARM support is pending relase of `netty-transport-native-epoll` v5). Unix sockets are not supported on other platforms or architectures.

### Reconnection

Reconnection is supported by the underlying GRPCBlockingStub. If connection to flagd is lost, it will reconnect automatically.

### Deadline (gRPC call timeout)

The deadline for an individual flag evaluation can be configured by calling `setDeadline(< deadline in millis >)`.
If the gRPC call is not completed within this deadline, the gRPC call is terminated with the error `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` and the evaluation will default.
The default deadline is 500ms, though evaluations typically take on the order of 10ms.

### TLS

Though not required in deployments where flagd runs on the same host as the workload, TLS is available.

:warning: Note that there's a [vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-IONETTY-1042268) in [netty](https://github.com/netty/netty), a transitive dependency of the underlying gRPC libraries used in the flagd-provider that fails to correctly validate certificates. This will be addressed in netty v5.

## Caching

The provider attempts to establish a connection to flagd's event stream (up to 5 times by default). If the connection is successful and caching is enabled each flag returned with reason `STATIC` is cached until an event is received concerning the cached flag (at which point it is removed from cache).

On invocation of a flag evaluation (if caching is available) an attempt is made to retrieve the entry from cache, if found the flag is returned with reason `CACHED`.

By default, the provider is configured to use [least recently used (lru)](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-collections/apidocs/org/apache/commons/collections4/map/LRUMap.html) caching with up to 1000 entries.
